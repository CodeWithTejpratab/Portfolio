                <h3>IOS-app-Matrix-calculator</h3>
                <p>
                    Led a group of 4 in a <b>IOS app project</b>. Created a Gauss and Gauss Jordan matrix calculator using <b>Swift</b> and <b>SwiftUI</b> for the frontend GUI, 
                    and <b>C++</b> for the backend. <b>Objective C </b> was used to bridge <b>C++</b> and <b>Swift</b>. This app provides a simple way for users to interact with the <b>Gauss Jordan</b> and <b>Gauss</b> algorithm, 
                    allowing user to solve systems of linear equations. The Gauss Jordan method is commonly used in chemistry to equalize chemical reactions.

                    <li>What specific goals and objectives we wanted to achieve with the app.</li>
                    <li>Create ways to test the app under various conditions to identify and resolve performance issues.</li>
                    <li>Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface.</li>
                    <li>Prioritize a seamless user experience to encourage engagement and retention.</li>

                    Of cource there are many more things to consider, but these are some of the things that fundamentally 
                    needed to be attended to. See <a href="https://github.com/CodeWithTejpratab/IOS-app-Matrix-calculator"><b>Github</b></a>.

                <p>
                    Led a team of 3 in a project. Created a Netflix Database system using MySQL and created a front-end
                    using python. Key features - User login system, subscription plan, and a movie/TV show rating system.

                <h3>What-To-Wear</h3>
                <p>   
                    A simple automated script, that runs on startup. Starting with <b>ZSHELL (zsh)</b> scripting Language, I coded a script that would communicate with Apple's iMessage to send a text message to any phone number that is provided to the script.
                    Then using an <b>API</b> from open-weather-map to gather temperature information. It sends 
                    a text message to the user stating what to wear based on the Temperature outside.
                    What's cool about this, is that you can have a file filled with phone numbers of family or friends who live in the same area.
                    The program would be able to send this message to each individual number. 
                    Feel free the view this project on my <a href="https://github.com/CodeWithTejpratab/What-To-Wear"><b>Github</b></a>.
